# Situation

## Russian decree just dropped. 

The order in my view does not necessarily presage a larger draft, or greater mobilization - it could, but it may be a way of accommodating the various current recruitment efforts to create additional volunteer battalions in the force, and build in room for force expansion.

My general view is that this is a procedural raising of the ceiling cap. One can speculate on how they intend to fill it, or if they can fill it given the problems with recruitment and retention. But I'd take care settling on one specific explanation at this point.
