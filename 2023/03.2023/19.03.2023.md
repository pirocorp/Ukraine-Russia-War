French are training to get ready for a possible mission in Ukraine / Moldova / Georgia üá´üá∑

Up to 20,000 NATO soldiers are exercising on the streets of France. The exercises are called Orion 23. According to exercise scenario, political instability began in a country bordering Russia, pro-Russian militias rebelled, and now the Alliance is ‚Äúrestoring order.‚Äù
