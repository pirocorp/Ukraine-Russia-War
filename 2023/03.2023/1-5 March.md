# First Week 1 - 5 March

Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov - speaking in India - tries to claim that Russia didn't start the war in Ukraine and that it was "launched against us". The audience laughs at him.

Russia is ruthless. Watch this video where Rogozin drowned a dog in front of Serbian President “for an experiment”(in part to show him “who’s the boss.”) Putin’s been on a power trip & he understands well how to treat other (weaker) authoritarian politicians.
