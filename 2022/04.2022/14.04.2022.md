# Moskva cruise ship

## The Moskva northwest of Sevastopol, April 10.

## Some thoughts on the survivability of the Moskva

Some thoughts on the survivability of the #Moskva given the Russians reported "ammunition detonating" aboard. The SA-N-4 SAMs (aft, yellow), the main gun and the ASM mortar magazines (fwd, yellow) are probably the most survivable.

The 64 S-300s in the aft 1/3 of a Slava each have 293-lb warheads. Those cooking off amidships would be extremely bad, but may not be 100% fatal. Any of the 1000-kg warheads of the P-1000s going off would probably destroy a Slava, and they can carry 16.

## R-360 Neptun has a 300 km range.

Here is a 300 km range circle from Sevastopol. If this was indeed a successful Neptun attack, the metric just changed dramatically for the Black Sea.

# Severodonetsk

From ~3 days ago, a nice compilation of reporting from Svatove about the possible massing of Central Military District units. Likely over 200 vehicles in 3 distinct columns moving along the pictured route

These forces have the option of being used directly against Severodonetsk or in a converging attack in the direction of Kramatorsk-Slovyansk in coordination with the Western Military District grouping at Izium.

# Klimovo, Russia

Today Klimovo, Bryansk Oblast ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º came under fire - as claimed, two Ukrainian helicopters, which invaded RU airspace, launched at least six rockets, injuring 7 civilians. The fragments found on site allow us to ID that the munitions used were S-13 122mm unguided rockets.

Such rockets are usually fired from B-13L-type launchers, which can be mounted both on jets and helicopters - however this is known that the Ukrainian military previously tested a Mi-8MSB-V helicopter with these rockets. The actual target of the operation is currently unknown.
