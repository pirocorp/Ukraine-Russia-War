## Donetsk

The AFU repulsed an attack around Krasnohorivka,. There are of course two of them, and I don't know which one, so flip a coin

## Bakhmut

Down at the Lada lottery around Bakhmut, the AFU repulsed attacks around Soledar Bakhmutske, Bakhmut, Andriivka and Kurdyumivka. Wargonzo also report fighting in Optyney. I do not believe there is any major change the last few days.

## Svatove-Siversk

The AFU repulsed an attack around Bilohorivka. Wargonzo report continued AFU offensives in the direction of Pishchane and Chervonopopivka.

## Svatove

The shellings might reveal the AFU intentions, we see shellings north and south of Svatove. It's very likely they will try to envelop Svatove instead of taking it head on. This could also be confirmation bias and a coincidence.

## Weather

A few more days of cold weather, then it's back to mud and misery.

### A drone attack on Tuesday struck near an air base in Russia, a local official said, a day after Ukraine used drones to hit two military bases deep inside Russia. If confirmed by Ukraine, it signals that it's willing to bring the conflict closer to Moscow.

### Russian officials claimed that UAVs attacked an airfield in Kursk, which ignited oil, and the Slava plant in Bryansk. Not clear how much, if any, damage occurred at the latter.
