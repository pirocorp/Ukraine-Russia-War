- Situation in Luhansk Obl extremely difficult
- Russia advances but slowly because of fierce Ukrainian resistance
- No russian 🇺troops on Bakhmut-Lysychansk road but it is within range of russian  fire, using it is dangerous
- Russians fight on outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, shell it w/mortars

The Russians are actively advancing in several directions at once. ZSU repulsed enemy attacks in the areas of Ustinivka, Kamyshevakh, Lypove, Nahirne, Krasnohorivka, Kamyanka, Avdiivka, Pisky and Zolota Nyva.

The increase in the number of missiles and artillery most likely indicate a transition to a Russian offensive in the direction of Slovyansk - Kramatorsk axis. It's believed that the Russians plan it to be the next stage after Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.
