## Sievierodonetsk

Russia has steady progress in Sievierodonetsk in hard urban combat. Nearly all forces avaliable are being thrown in. At the same time, Ukrainian units keep fighting in the streets, but many also retreat to Lysychansk the main defense point on a higher ground.

The regional governor of Luhansk has told that at least 70% of Severodonetsk is now under Russian control but the fighting is ongoing. This morning that figure was said to be 50%. Highly likely that the Ukrainians are conducting a fighting retreat from Severodonetsk right now.


## Lyman

General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: 

"In the Lyman direction, some russian enemy units were withdrawn from the Lyman settlement".

## Kharkiv

The western sources report on the counteroffensive of the ZSU north of the Kharkiv. According to the sources, Ukrainian ðŸ‡¦forces cut the northern group of Russians into two parts, thereby complicating the supply of these combat groups. Also, the ZSU is getting closer to the Russian border.
