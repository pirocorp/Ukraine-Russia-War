# Ukrainian Army Toys

## More footage of Czech provided RM-70 multiple rocket launchers in action in Eastern Ukraine.

This is an armoured Czechoslovak version of the BM-21 "Grad" MLRS, which also has a faster reload rate. Around 20 units were provided by Czechia in April.

# Destroyed

## The Ukrainian 45th Artillery Brigade hit a Russian position with artillery fire, apparently observed by the UA-made Spectator-M1 UAV. A supply truck was destroyed. Damage to other vehicles is possible, but very difficult to determine.

## Video story of the bright elimination of the 240-mm self-propelled mortar "Tulip". 

With his help, the occupiers destroyed the bridge and destroyed the houses of Severodonetsk. NMU and ZSU gunners first lured him out of the hangar and then destroyed him. Thank you to Russian propagandists for the tip.
