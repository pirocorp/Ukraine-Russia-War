# Bilohorivka

## Russian troops attempting to cross a river in Eastern Ukraine were destroyed by Ukrainian defenders in the area.

Ukrainian 17th Separate Tank Brigade was the unit involved at Bilohorivka. Low confidence assessment the Russian unit was from 90th Guards Tank Division based on equipment and previous location. Much of the equipment is hard to recognize with current footage though.
