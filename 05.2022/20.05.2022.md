Drone footage filmed for the Ukrainian military, and obtained by The Times, showed Russian soldiers standing next to the men’s bodies a day after the execution.

Still images from a surveillance camera opposite 144 Yablunska Street showed Russian paratroopers occupying Bucha around the same time the group of men were executed.

Security camera footage obtained by The Times showed Russian troops re-entering Bucha near 144 Yablunska Street on March 3 and 4.

Translated text messages between Denys Rudenko and his friend, Ivan Andriychuk, show the last communication they had before he was killed. Mr. Rudenko never responded to Mr. Andriychuk’s last question.

The soldiers debated what to do with the remaining men. “Get rid of them, but not here, so their bodies aren’t laid around,” one said, according to Mr. Skyba.

Four weeks later, after Russian forces had withdrawn from Bucha, Times reporters visited the scene of the executions. The wall and steps of the building were pockmarked by bullet holes. On the other side of the courtyard, scattered a few feet from where the bodies lay, were spent 7.62x54R cartridge casings, used in the Soviet-designed PK-series machine guns and Dragunov sniper rifles commonly used by Russian troops. The Times also found an unfired 7.62x54R round inside the building.

Packing slips found in crates of ammunition, left behind by Russian forces, identified two paratrooper units — the 104th and the 234th Air Assault Regiments — who may have occupied the building.

A note photographed next to an unidentified body, and circulated on Telegram, provided details about the person for anyone who may be looking for him. The man was later identified as Valera Kotenko. The note reads: “Bucha city, 144 Yablunska Street. Is wearing a black T-shirt and blue joggers with three white stripes.”
