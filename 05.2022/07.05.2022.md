# Izyum

## 2x Russian 152mm 2S3 (49.6907, 36.8938)

Near Izyum, 2x Russian 152mm 2S3 Akatsiya self-propelled howitzers were struck by Ukrainian counter-battery fire, destroying them both when the ammo on board detonated. As claimed, Western supplied "high precision" artillery was used, and as can be seen, was effective.
