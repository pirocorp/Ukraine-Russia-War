## FH70

Recently delivered Italian FH70 155mm howitzers in use with the Ukrainian army. Interestingly, the projectiles seen here are Finnish 155 tkr88 (a derrivative of French LU 111 HE) with a range of 24 kilometers. This may be a part of recent undisclosed aid from Finland. Looked more deeply into this FH70 - and we believe this particular example was supplied by Estonia. It has very distinctive 3-color camo and the most importantly the truck used to tow it is a MAN Kat 1 6x6 - as used by the Estonian army.
