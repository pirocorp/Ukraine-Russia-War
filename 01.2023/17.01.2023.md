## Svateove

If the AFU can hold on to Novoselivs'ke they will be in a good positions to envelop Kuzemivka and Kryvoshyivka. As can be seen on Pic 1, Novoselivs'ke is high ground and they will have a good view of Kuzemivka from there.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/212973070-9b7c2736-ac74-4693-bcd4-e262c0c6f6d7.png)

I think the next step will be to take control of the high ground towards Sosnovyi, this village has overview of Svatove and they will be able to direct fire on to all of the access roads going in to Svatove. One problem might be the RU held fortified position just to the south.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/212973205-916a19dd-93be-48b1-b6e3-b8ba23e5f9b7.png)

This is what it looks like from the high ground west of Svatove looking down at the town. As you can see, it's a pretty good position to have, and it will be quite hard to attack up the hills for RuAF.

Controlling Novoselivs'ke ,Kuzemivka and Kryvoshyivka could also greatly improve the AFU logistics in the area since they might be able to get a buffer along the P-07 road. The AFU more or less need to push RuAF down the hill and grab control of as much of P-07 as they can.

They also need to expand the Kupyansk bridge head, at the moment it's in RU artillery range.

## Kreminna-Siversk

RuAF seems to be focusing on disrupting the UA Kreminna effort by attacking the flank. Battle Group K2 (which we saw steal a RU radio with a drone) together with 54th Brigade has been kicking Russian ass in this area for months.

## Bakhmut

I consider Soledar captured by RuAF. The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Krasnopolivka, Sil, Soledar and Bilohorivka. I have not seen any sings of RuAF crossing the Bakhmutovka river north of Bakhmut.

## Bakhmut south

The AFU repulsed attacks around Bakhmut, Klishchiivka and Pivnichne. Some RU sources claimed Klishchiivka had been captured by RuAF, but this is disputed by other RU channels. Intense fighting is going on around this key area.

## Donetsk

Increased activity in this area. The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Krasnohorivka, Vodyane,  Nevel's'ke, Maryinka and Pobjeda.
