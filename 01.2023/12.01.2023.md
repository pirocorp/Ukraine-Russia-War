## Svatove-Kreminna

The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Stel'makhivka and Kreminna. The AFU are most likely around 1500-2500 meters from the first houses in Kreminna. The Ukrainian general staff also mentioned a RU shelling in the area of Kreminna.

## Bakhmut North

The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Rozdolivka, SÑ–lj, Krasna Gora, Paraskoviivka, Pidgorodne and Bakhmut. There are also pro RU mentions of attacks in the area of Blahodatne. The RU forces have some momentum and they have made important progress the last days.

Eyes are now on the last part of Soledar, Krasna Hora and Paraskoviivka area. If RuAF are able to progress and establish positions here, they have a control of the northern supply route to Bakhmut.

## Soledar

This is my assessment of Soledar. The situation is unclear, but I do not believe in any encirclements. This is mainly based on geolocated images and satellite images.

## Bakhmut S

The AFU repulsed attacks around Klishchiivka and Mayorsk. The heights west of Klishchiivka are heavily fortified. The Russians need to advance in this area too if they want to capture Bakhmut. They will not be able to take the city head on, they will need to encircle and cut of supplies.
