## Overview images

Keep in mind, the frontline is constantly moving and positions are changing hands.

## Kupyansk-Soledar

The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Hryanykivka and Stel'makhivka. No significant change, but I saw rumors about AFU making some progress in the Stel'makhivka direction. Regarding Kreminna, no news is good news, this means RU are defending and not attacking.

## Bakhmut N

The AFU repulsed attacks around Spirne, Rozdolivka, Vesele and Bakhmut. The situation in Soledar is still unclear, but it think it's likely RU forces control about 75% of it.

## Bakhmut S

The AFU repulsed attacks around Klishchiivka and Mayorsk.  Klishchiivka is the door stop south of Bakhmut, similar to Soledar in the north. RU need to take it (and the fortified heights west of it) in order to actually do a serious attempt at Bakhmut.

## Donetsk

The AFU repulsed attacks in the area of Vodyane, Nevelske, Krasnohorivka, Maryinka and Prechistivka. Everyone is focusing on Soledar, especially they Russians since this is the greatest achievement by them since June. That means not a lot of info is coming out of Donetsk.
