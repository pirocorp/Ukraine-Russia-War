The control map from reflects the fighting we have seen in eastern Ukraine today, specifically focused around the Izyum, Popasna and Severodonetsk areas. There still does not seem to be a major breakout by Russian forces at the moment, though they may not have committed all of their available combat power in the area. The US assessed that they moved 4 additional BTGs into Ukraine in the last 24 hours, 3 of which went into the Donbas.
