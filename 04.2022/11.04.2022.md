# Velyka Novosilka

## Little bit of a stealth update to add a possible location for 70th GMRR.

Little bit of a stealth update to add a possible location for 70th GMRR. A report stated a BTG commander for 70th was killed in Donetsk Oblast. Combined with the location of 71st, it leads me to believe its probably in the west of the oblast, possibly south of Velyka Novosilka
