Ukrainian defences continue to hold along the majority of the front line. The Russian advance on the east bank of the Oskil river continued to progress again today. Russian captured Lozove and fighting has now reached Rubsti and Yats'kivka.

In the South, Russians took control of a number of villages south and west of Velyka Novosilka.
