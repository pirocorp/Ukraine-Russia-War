# Moscow (ship) before she sinks

And here is the first, confirmed frame of "Moscow" after .. the incident.

There are traces of a powerful fire in the compartments, traces of damage to the skin under the main superstructure and a roll to the port side (everything, according to the reports of the Armed Forces of Ukraine). PU with KR are intact, their detonation obviously did not occur.

A second image of the "Moskva", the morning she was struck by two Ukrainian anti-ship missiles. The sea state is clearly fairly calm - which is line with independent reports, but contradicts statements from the Russian Ministry of Defence.
