## Some thoughts on the survivability of the Moskva

Some thoughts on the survivability of the #Moskva given the Russians reported "ammunition detonating" aboard. The SA-N-4 SAMs (aft, yellow), the main gun and the ASM mortar magazines (fwd, yellow) are probably the most survivable.

The 64 S-300s in the aft 1/3 of a Slava each have 293-lb warheads. Those cooking off amidships would be extremely bad, but may not be 100% fatal. Any of the 1000-kg warheads of the P-1000s going off would probably destroy a Slava, and they can carry 16.

## R-360 Neptun has a 300 km range.

Here is a 300 km range circle from Sevastopol. If this was indeed a successful Neptun attack, the metric just changed dramatically for the Black Sea.
