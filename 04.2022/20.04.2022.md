# Mariupol 

## Up to 4 days ago

Ukrainian Marines and Azov, supported by armored vehicles, conducted a successful breakthrough operation towards the harbor in Mariupol to help fellow servicemen defending the area. About 500 fighters of Ukrainian Border Guards and National Police reportedly requested assistance after the latter one was running low on ammo. They have been all successfully evacuated to Azovstal Plant.
