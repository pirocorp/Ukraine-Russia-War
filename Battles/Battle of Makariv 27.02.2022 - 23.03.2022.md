This transmission is about a battle in Motyzhyn, a village southeast of Makariv, in which call sign YUG-95 reports his unit pulled out of the battle and lost an armored tracked vehicle called an MT-LB.

We matched YUG-95's report with a Telegram post of the mayor of Makariv (“our guys are mowing down enemy column near Motyzhyn”), videos showing Russian vehicles entering the village that day, along with damaged and abandoned armor, including an MT-LB.

Motyzhyn is just one of many specific battle locations around Makariv that we heard Russian troops mention on the radio intercepts. We cross-checked these with visuals we geolocated to document sites and times of Russian military activity.

It's the morning of Feb. 27 when residents spot V-marked military vehicles moving into the area: from Borodianka to Lypivka and then Makariv.

Soon, we hear Russian troops on the radio giving battlefield updates — and openly disclosing attack plans for anyone to hear. Here, they're claiming they shot down an Ukrainian helicopter with “two Strela [missiles].”

The language is often raw. In this transmission, an intention to strike is disclosed. “Give me all the coordinates, let's make strikes. We'll [expletive] blow them apart into pieces, these [expletive]  [expletive]. Over.”

In another transmission, we hear the repeated order to cover the entire residential neighbourhood with artillery after the “property” (хозяйство) has been removed — a likely codeword for Russian personnel or equipment. This could be a war crime.

Residents in Makariv and surrounding villages including Kopylov and Motyzhyn told us Russian forces fired randomly into their houses with small arms and at least once with a tank round, as what happened to this house where a family was sheltering in Lypivka. They survived.

The following notorious CCTV footage shows a Russian BMP-2 vehicle rolling into view in Makariv and firing several rounds into a civilian sedan — without any apparent warning or provocation. The elderly couple inside was killed instantly.

What's interesting to note is that —outside of the “cover the residential neighbourhood with artillery”— we haven't noted Russian units discussing these incidents with civilians on the radio. Instead, we hear them talking about their own losses.

Russian troops in Makariv were met with fierce resistance and took significant losses. This transmission captures a frantic dispatch of a unit under attack. The voice is in clear distress.

The Russian unit also spotted a likely Ukrainian drone over the area while they were “under fire from all directions.” Later that evening, a video was released showing a Bayraktar drone strike, which we geolocated the video to northern Makariv.

The next morning, Feb. 28, a Ukrainian fighter filmed the drone strike aftermath and sent it to us. “Look what we have here [...] a destroyed part of the Russian column. Radars, BUKs, tractor trailer/towing vehicle, SAU [self-propelled artillery].”

In this series of exchanges, we hear how comms failures delay urgent requests for Russian air support amid mounting casualties. Thirty minutes after the unit requested help: “You forgot about air support, [expletive] air support! You forgot!”

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/159812961-5931cd86-b892-4c31-a181-7375b06a1d61.mp4


The radio chatter is full of Russian troops who lack critical supplies, too. Two examples:

“I urgently need refueling, water, and food.”

“Vehicles stalling in the road. Urgently need fuel.”

Ukrainian officials claimed yesterday that they've pushed the Russian forces out of Makariv, nearly a month after they moved in. But at a devastating cost. And fighting in the area continues.
