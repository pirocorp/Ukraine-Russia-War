20 Combined Arms Army axis. As stated many thought pre-war this would be a main RuAF axis of advance so as to envelope UAF eastern forces. Despite initial mad-dash to Kyiv, RuAF now push here although little media coverage.


# 26.02.2022

## Kupiansk 

Kupiansk was considered as a possible main axis of advance towards Izyum - Kramatorsk, but so far RuAF seems more focused in the north of the oblast around Kharkiv.

## Kupiansk 

Kupiansk was entered by RUAFfollowing the Mayor declaring that he transferred his powers to Russia (later charged with treason). Here a T-72 + BMP-2. One soldier on the back aims at the person filming him.

After the Russian entry into Kupiansk, some residents protested and attacked a RuAF SUV.

With terrain flat, open + hard to defend UAF pulled back to forests along Siverskyi Donets River.


# 04.03.22

RuAF reached Izyum outskirts.


# 06.03.22

Initial attacks are repulsed.

2 Russian BTGs unsucessfully tried to capture the city of Izium. Then they resorted to the practice of shelling residential areas, firing from artillery almost all night with several air strikes.

The main UAF unit covering the RuAF advance on Izyum is the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade. However it  also has to cover a large frontage further east into NW Luhansk. Here they claimed the destruction of RuAF T-72BA or B3 near Izyum.

# 07.03.22

UAF still hold the city south of Siverskyi Donets river. So as of 07/03 not fully captured, 81st not crushed, advance not progressing rapidly.


# 12.03.22

Still the UAF is undeniably under huge pressure around Izyum and suffering losses. Internet is reportedly interrupted but film that does get out shows huge devastation in some parts of the town.


# 13.03.22

Some of the devastation in Izyum has been from air strikes. Ukraine claimed one RuAF aircraft was downed. A 2nd film in link shows 2 parachutes so possibly a Su-30SM or Su-34.

# 14.03.22

RuAF also reportedly used BM-30 Smerch MLRS near Izium. RuAF presence at north of river 3x T-72B3M at 49.184570, 37.245190 Likely 26 Gds Tank Regt.

T-72B3M in video seems to have same red unit mark as this. This is from 26 Gds Tank Regt (single dot in white square = 1st batt).

This is also unit RU claimed returned to base in prewar false propaganda.

Russian forces reportedly crossed the Siverskyi Donets River in an apparent attempt to outflank Izyum to the south west, but were reportedly repulsed.

Further lending that 1st battalion of 26th Grds Tank Regt is around Izyum are these captured effects from 6th Separate Tank Bde, a unit defunct since 12/2020 when it was renamed/reformed as the 26th

# 17.03.22

Despite failed crossing of Siverskyi Donets River, further east RuAF are south of river at Kam'yanka. Artillery strikes there (49.1067791, 37.2815292). Seems at least 8 vehicles destroyed. UAF still in Izyum but road cut off.

Ukrainian BDA of destroyed 26th Grds Tank Regt column at Kamyanka dam twt 12-14. One slide states 'moving toward Sukha Kam'yanka village' 4.5 km east.

A wider RuAF grouping at Kamyanka, Izyum maybe smashed. 26th Guards Regt is in the area. UAF claim '437th Training Regt + battalion-tactical group of 26th tank regt, 47th tank div stopped'.

Video from the Ukrainian military showing several destroyed or captured Russian BMP-3 and BMP-2 vehicles reportedly from Russia's 47th Tank Division in Kamyanka, Kharkiv. It looks like this happened near a pontoon bridge, possibly by anti-tank mines.

Another video from the same location shows the same BMP-2 as well as a R-149MA1 command-staff vehicle.

Another video from the same location shows a destroyed MT-LB, probably a BMP-2, and a tank.

Another video showing the destroyed Russian vehicles from the same location. Looks like 7 BMP-3 or more, MT-LB, BMP, truck, and a tank.

Destroyed RuAF column (BTG 26th Grds Tank Regt + 437th Training Regt) is at 49.106303,37.282868, same location as artillery hits seen.


So not a pontoon bridge. RuAF remain south of SD river.
