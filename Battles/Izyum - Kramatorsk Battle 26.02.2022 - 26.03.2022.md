20 Combined Arms Army axis. As stated many thought pre-war this would be a main RuAF axis of advance so as to envelope UAF eastern forces. Despite initial mad-dash to Kyiv, RuAF now push here although little media coverage.


# 26.02.2022

## Kupiansk 

Kupiansk was considered as a possible main axis of advance towards Izyum - Kramatorsk, but so far RuAF seems more focused in the north of the oblast around Kharkiv.

# 04.03.22

RuAF reached Izyum outskirts.


# 06.03.22

Initial attacks are repulsed.

2 Russian BTGs unsucessfully tried to capture the city of Izium. Then they resorted to the practice of shelling residential areas, firing from artillery almost all night with several air strikes.

The main UAF unit covering the RuAF advance on Izyum is the 81st Separate Airmobile Brigade. However it  also has to cover a large frontage further east into NW Luhansk. Here they claimed the destruction of RuAF T-72BA or B3 near Izyum.

# 07.03.22

UAF still hold the city south of Siverskyi Donets river. So as of 07/03 not fully captured, 81st not crushed, advance not progressing rapidly.


# 12.03.22

Still the UAF is undeniably under huge pressure around Izyum and suffering losses. Internet is reportedly interrupted but film that does get out shows huge devastation in some parts of the town.


# 13.03.22

Some of the devastation in Izyum has been from air strikes. Ukraine claimed one RuAF aircraft was downed. A 2nd film in link shows 2 parachutes so possibly a Su-30SM or Su-34.
