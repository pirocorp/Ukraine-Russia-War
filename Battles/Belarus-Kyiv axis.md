# Belarus-Kyiv axis

Kyiv axis of the 29th, 35th, + 36th Combined Arms Armies. Note I'll still cover Hostomel/Bucha/Irpin fighting in a separate thread.


# 25.02.22

Russian forces quickly took Chernobyl close to the Belarus border

Seems limited resistance before Chernobyl as UAF light forces withdrew +odd ambush. RuAF film shows some UAF losses. IMO only UAF Kozak-2s + BTR-70s in this film are Chernobyl captures. Others in film recorded elsewhere or BMPs filmed at unclear angle.
