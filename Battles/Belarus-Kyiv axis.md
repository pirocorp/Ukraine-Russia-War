# Belarus-Kyiv axis

Kyiv axis of the 29th, 35th, + 36th Combined Arms Armies. Note I'll still cover Hostomel/Bucha/Irpin fighting in a separate thread.


# 25.02.22

Russian forces quickly took Chernobyl close to the Belarus border

Seems limited resistance before Chernobyl as UAF light forces withdrew +odd ambush. RuAF film shows some UAF losses. IMO only UAF Kozak-2s + BTR-70s in this film are Chernobyl captures. Others in film recorded elsewhere or BMPs filmed at unclear angle.

RuAF also moved beyond Chernobyl on 24th towards road hub of Ivankiv. They met resistance 1.5 km north of town at 50.9649823, 29.9106049. Rosgvardia shelter behind a RKhM Kashalot NBC recce vehicle, likely used in passage through Chernobyl.

As RuAF approached Ivankiv UAF resistance stiffened including with armour. Here at least two UAF T-64s, 3x BMP-1s + troops with NLAW move to block ring road NW of Ivankiv at 50.951198, 29.880357. Vehicles burn ahead but unclear if UAF or RuAF.

A second enlarged film of same location in twt 4, shows 3 vehicles burning at the ring road junction NW of Ivankiv. Seems three more trucks are abandoned. There is a UAF T-64BV and a BMP-1 which fires and moves. Seems UAF hold the junction at this point

A later film at same location shows some of the RuAF losses from the battle at this junction north west of Ivankiv. In the background: BTR-80 (probably), 3 burnt out trucks, an abandoned/damaged Ural and a seemingly abandoned KamAZ.
