# Belarus-Kyiv axis

Kyiv axis of the 29th, 35th, + 36th Combined Arms Armies. Note I'll still cover Hostomel/Bucha/Irpin fighting in a separate thread.


# 25.02.22

Russian forces quickly took Chernobyl close to the Belarus border

Seems limited resistance before Chernobyl as UAF light forces withdrew +odd ambush. RuAF film shows some UAF losses. IMO only UAF Kozak-2s + BTR-70s in this film are Chernobyl captures. Others in film recorded elsewhere or BMPs filmed at unclear angle.

RuAF also moved beyond Chernobyl on 24th towards road hub of Ivankiv. They met resistance 1.5 km north of town at 50.9649823, 29.9106049. Rosgvardia shelter behind a RKhM Kashalot NBC recce vehicle, likely used in passage through Chernobyl.

As RuAF approached Ivankiv UAF resistance stiffened including with armour. Here at least two UAF T-64s, 3x BMP-1s + troops with NLAW move to block ring road NW of Ivankiv at 50.951198, 29.880357. Vehicles burn ahead but unclear if UAF or RuAF.

A second enlarged film of same location in twt 4, shows 3 vehicles burning at the ring road junction NW of Ivankiv. Seems three more trucks are abandoned. There is a UAF T-64BV and a BMP-1 which fires and moves. Seems UAF hold the junction at this point

A later film at same location shows some of the RuAF losses from the battle at this junction north west of Ivankiv. In the background: BTR-80 (probably), 3 burnt out trucks, an abandoned/damaged Ural and a seemingly abandoned KamAZ.

# 26.02.22

On 25/02/22, UAF destroyed a key bridge in Ivankiv on the Teteriv River. RuAF forces nevertheless bypassed Ivankiv continuing to Kyiv. RuAF entered Ivankiv on 26th but fighting continued in or around for a week. Here some 5th Guards Tank Brigade losses.

Two Russian T-72B tanks and BTR-80 APC were destroyed during the attack on Russian troops in Ivankiv, north of Kyiv

# 05.03.22

Meanwhile to NW of Ivankiv elements of 29th Combined Army Army followed later. Its believed they will guard west flank of push to Kyiv.

The camouflaged Buk air defence system in video is probably guarding this pontoon bridge shown in the film 500 meters to south. Its there as the UAF blew the bridge over the river Uzh also in the film, just west at 51.247799, 29.400913. Pontoon bridge is located just to the east 51.251168, 29.405085.

# 19.03.22

I guess the bridge might be targeted by air or artillery. But if UAF was to go sneaky on it, be aware there is a BMP-1 + squad from 69 Covering Brigade at 51.253337, 29.404691 also T-72B3 nearby. Elsewhere a TOS-1A + TZM-T.
