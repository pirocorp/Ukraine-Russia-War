## MiG-31K deployments

A MiG-31K was spotted landing with a Kh-47M2 at Kaliningrad Chkalovsky AB, Kaliningrad Oblast on February 7, 2022. 

Another MiG-31K landed at Khmeimim Airbase at Latakia, Syria around February 15, 2022. it is also armed with Kh-47M2.

Paired with a MiG-31K, the Kh-47M2 "Khinzhal" (Russian: Х-47М2 Кинжал; NATO: "Killjoy") is said in Russian media TASS July 18, 2018 to have a range of 2000 km.

## Range to US carriers

By coincidence, both US carriers (which recently came under NATO command) were positioned just outside the 2000 km range of these Kh-47M2-armed MiG-31Ks right as the G7 meeting started in Munich, Germany (with Truman out of range of both).

## Hypothesis

A Tu-22 has greater range & can deliver more Kh-47M2s, but a smaller high-altitude fighter like the MiG-31K is much harder to track. NATO also has nothing that can match the speed or altitude of a MiG-31.
