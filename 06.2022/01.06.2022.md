## Davydiv Brid

Satellite imagery from May 31 shows that Russian troops look to have withdrawn from Davydiv Brid and set up positions in locations around the town in the past few days. It's not clear if Ukrainian troops have entered the town, but they have positions near Andriivka and Bilohirka.

## Kherson

The Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast has gotten the attention of Russian forces in the area. The Russians are now scrambling to secure the vital ground line of communication (GLOC) the Ukrainians have threatened.

## Poland will sell 3 squadrons of AHS 155 Krab self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including 54 AHS-155 KRAB systems, in addition to the recently shipped 18. These are newly manufactured vehicles, and Korea will help speed up delivery by sending ready-made K9 chassis from stock.

A bit of what itâ€™s like moving around out in the east. This was between artillery volley

The roads are filled with military equipment, including tanks.

â€¦and trunks carrying pontoon bridges.

The closer you get to the front the more it looks like this on the roads. Black smoke all around. Shelling audible from everywhere. Nowhere is completely safe and thereâ€™s no direct route or straight path to any place.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/171518749-c3b9c47d-c403-49cd-ab3d-e14be7ffc58e.mp4


Itâ€™s Ukraineâ€™s industrial heartland, so there are countless factories, smokestacks, and slag heaps.

But there plenty of natural beauty too.

â€¦ a lot of it actually.

And amid the devastating fighting there is life and there are people going about their business somehow. Life, in a way, goes on.

One thing you quickly realize is that the air raid sirens not only wail frequently, but they do so consistently for several minutes or even hours without a break. Hereâ€™s the siren in a very empty and eerie Kramatorsk.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/171519074-9d3bcdbd-c27d-4107-9d98-d5f51f180da5.mp4


And the siren in Druzhkivka just to the south. It wailed for hours that evening. The airstrike never came. Not there at least. But the threat persists and that is what is mentally exhausting for so many people.

Bonus Kramatorsk scooter footage. ðŸ›´ Theyâ€™re everywhere and people like them even more now with fuel as rare and expensive as it is.
