## Davydiv Brid

Satellite imagery from May 31 shows that Russian troops look to have withdrawn from Davydiv Brid and set up positions in locations around the town in the past few days. It's not clear if Ukrainian troops have entered the town, but they have positions near Andriivka and Bilohirka.

## Poland will sell 3 squadrons of AHS 155 Krab self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including 54 AHS-155 KRAB systems, in addition to the recently shipped 18. These are newly manufactured vehicles, and Korea will help speed up delivery by sending ready-made K9 chassis from stock.

# Destroyed

## Post-combat banter. Basically they just took out that Russian BTR with a grenade, themselves are a little contused, but in excellent spirits.
