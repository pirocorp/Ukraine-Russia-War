## Davydiv Brid

Satellite imagery from May 31 shows that Russian troops look to have withdrawn from Davydiv Brid and set up positions in locations around the town in the past few days. It's not clear if Ukrainian troops have entered the town, but they have positions near Andriivka and Bilohirka.

## Poland will sell 3 squadrons of AHS 155 Krab self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, including 54 AHS-155 KRAB systems, in addition to the recently shipped 18. These are newly manufactured vehicles, and Korea will help speed up delivery by sending ready-made K9 chassis from stock.

## Ukrainian forces with the M109, most likely the M109A3GN donated by Norway. We’ve heard reports that they were in use with the 72nd mechanized brigade.

# Destroyed

## Post-combat banter. Basically they just took out that Russian BTR with a grenade, themselves are a little contused, but in excellent spirits.

A bit of what it’s like moving around out in the east. This was between artillery volley

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/171518489-13257112-3e50-4fc2-9be2-4e3f46178619.mp4


The roads are filled with military equipment, including tanks.

…and trunks carrying pontoon bridges.

The closer you get to the front the more it looks like this on the roads. Black smoke all around. Shelling audible from everywhere. Nowhere is completely safe and there’s no direct route or straight path to any place.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/171518749-c3b9c47d-c403-49cd-ab3d-e14be7ffc58e.mp4


It’s Ukraine’s industrial heartland, so there are countless factories, smokestacks, and slag heaps.

But there plenty of natural beauty too.

… a lot of it actually.

And amid the devastating fighting there is life and there are people going about their business somehow. Life, in a way, goes on.

One thing you quickly realize is that the air raid sirens not only wail frequently, but they do so consistently for several minutes or even hours without a break. Here’s the siren in a very empty and eerie Kramatorsk.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34960418/171519074-9d3bcdbd-c27d-4107-9d98-d5f51f180da5.mp4


And the siren in Druzhkivka just to the south. It wailed for hours that evening. The airstrike never came. Not there at least. But the threat persists and that is what is mentally exhausting for so many people.

Bonus Kramatorsk scooter footage. 🛴 They’re everywhere and people like them even more now with fuel as rare and expensive as it is.
